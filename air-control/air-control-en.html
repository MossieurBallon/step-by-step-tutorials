			This photo tutorial is a companion piece to the video <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-11-skill-6-air-pressure-control">Balloon Twisting From Scratch 11 - Skill 6: Air Pressure Control</a> which you can also find on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MossieurBallon">Môssieur Ballon's YouTube channel</a>.

		<p>
			This is probably the most important basic skill you need to know and master: air pressure control. How do you avoid the balloon bursting if there's too much pressure, or on the other hand, avoid it getting undone if there's not enough?
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you know how to manage both worst-case scenarios, all you will need to do is to keep an eye on the pressure of the air in your balloon at each step of creating your models so that you can spread it out evenly from start to finish. You can very well use  both of these skills one after the other, while making a single balloon model, in order to modulate how the air pressure evolves to match your assessment of what's needed at any given moment.

				<figcaption>1- To practice, we are going to make two versions of the classic dog sculpture (<a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-1-the-doggy">see the balloon dog tutorial</a>). The first balloon won't be inflated enough, while the second will be far too much.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step02.jpg">
				<figcaption>2- Take the under-inflated balloon (with a margin much wider than your hand). The tactic will be simple, you'll have to  use as much latex as possible... and as little air as possible!</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step03.jpg">
				<figcaption>3- Start by squeezing the balloon near the knot, to displace air pressure towards the end of the balloon. Use both hands, if necessary, to push the air even farther.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step04.jpg">
				<figcaption>4- When making the first bubble, twist the balloon 2 or 3 times more than usual (turn it 7 or 8 times at least) to "use up" the most latex as possible.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step05.jpg">
				<figcaption>5- Once the first bubble is finished, squeeze the balloon again to push back the pressure that built up again after you made the first bubble. </figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step06.jpg">
				<figcaption>6- Make a second bubble, again twisting the balloon far more than needed, with the purpose still being to use more latex than necessary.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step07.jpg">
				<figcaption>7- Next, don't forget to push back the air pressure towards the end of the balloon again,</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step08.jpg">
				<figcaption>8- Then the third bubble in the same way.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step09.jpg">
				<figcaption>9- And so on and so forth, for each of the following bubbles.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step10.jpg">
				<figcaption>10- After several bubbles created this way, the margin at the end of the balloon has shrunk noticeably.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step11.jpg">
				<figcaption>11- And in the end, you get a sculpture with pressure that's perfectly balanced throughout the design.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step12.jpg">
				<figcaption>12- For the balloon that's been inflated too much, the tactic used will be exactly the opposite. You'll have to use as much air as possible... while using the least latex as possible.</figcaption>
			</figure>

				<img src="images/step13.jpg">
				<figcaption>13- One starting trick is to latch onto the knot of the balloon...</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step14.jpg">
				<figcaption>14- and tug it back to displace it and free up the inch or so of latex that's caught in the knot (as long as the knot wasn't tied too tightly in the first place).</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step15.jpg">
				<figcaption>15- Then, turn the balloon over,</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step16.jpg">
				<figcaption>16- And firmly press the end of the balloon so that the air goes back into the space that's been freed up by the knot.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step17.jpg">
				<figcaption>17- With a bit of luck, by doing this you can get an inch or so of your margin back.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step18.jpg">
				<figcaption>18- Here is the somewhat deformed space where the air was able to move back to, just next to the knot, freeing up that much space at the end of the balloon.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step19.jpg">
				<figcaption>19- When starting the first bubble, twist it as little as possible (once or twice at most).</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step20.jpg">
				<figcaption>20- Make the second one in the same fashion. The air pressure in the bubbles being higher, they will be a little more prone to bursting, so you will need to handle them a little more delicately. </figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step21.jpg">
				<figcaption>21- Go on like this with the next ones… <strong>whatever you do, do not squeeze the balloon</strong> in order to push the air pressure forward, since <strong>it needs to remain as compressed as possible</strong>.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step22.jpg">
				<figcaption>22- Several bubbles have been done in this fashion and you'll notice that there's still some margin left at the end of the balloon (practically as much as there was on the first balloon at this stage of development).</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step23.jpg">
				<figcaption>23- And in the end, here too, we get a sculpture with pressure that's perfectly balanced throughout the design.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step24.jpg">
				<figcaption>24- Here are the two sculptures side by side. The only noticeable difference is that one is larger while the other is smaller, but the proportions of both sculptures are harmonious, and much the same.</figcaption>
