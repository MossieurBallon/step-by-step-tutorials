			This little doggy embodies the very basics of balloon sculpture, sort of like the famous "Hello World" of programming. Indeed, it's typically the first balloon sculpture a novice needs to learn to master, because, in doing so, he will become familiar with several important basic notions of balloon sculpture.

				<figcaption>1- Inflate a balloon leaving a margin at the end of about the width of a hand. Then tie a knot without making it too tight.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>2- Starting from the knotted end, make a first bubble about three fingers wide at most. This will be the dog's head.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>3- Make two more bubbles following it, of the same size as the first. These will be its two ears.</figcaption>
