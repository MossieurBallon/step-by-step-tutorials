			This photo tutorial is a companion piece for the video <a href="https://mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-5-tux-the-penguin">Balloon Twisting From Scratch 5 - Tux the Penguin</a> which you can also find on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MossieurBallon">Môssieur Ballon's YouTube channel</a>.

		<p>
			Despite appearances, this balloon sculpture is actually quite simple to create, because as with <a href="https://mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-4-the-tiger">the tiger</a> and <a href="https://mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-3-the-frog">the frog</a>, it only makes use of skills which have already been presented in the first two tutorials in the Balloon Twisting From Scratch series: <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-1-the-doggy">the doggy</a> and <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-2-the-sword">the sword</a>. However, just using and blending 3 balloons of 3 different colors together gives this sculpture a much more technical and finished look.

				<figcaption>1- Inflate a white balloon leaving a margin at the end of slightly more than the width of a hand. Then tie the knot.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step02.jpg">
				<figcaption>2- Do likewise with a black balloon and tie the knotted end of each balloon together.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step03.jpg">
				<figcaption>3- With the white balloon, make a first oval bubble about three fingers wide.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step04.jpg">
				<figcaption>4- Make a second, identical bubble, following the first.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step05.jpg">
				<figcaption>5- Twist the bubbles several times around their base to keep them in place. We already have our penguin's eyes!  </figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step06.jpg">
				<figcaption>6- Roll the black balloon along the groove located between the two white bubbles. In this way, shape a wide black loop and bring its base to the base of the two white bubbles.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step07.jpg">
				<figcaption>7- Twist the two white bubbles and the black loop several times around their base to keep them in place. We've just made the head of our penguin.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step08.jpg">
				<figcaption>8- <a href="https://mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-11-skill-6-air-pressure-control">Push the air</a> to the end of the remaining portion of black balloon (don't bother with the remaining portion of white balloon for the moment), you should get a shape similar to this one.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step09.jpg">
				<figcaption>9- Make a zigzag with the rest of the black balloon so that the last segment is slightly longer than the first two. Make a mental note of the position of each of the two bends thus formed.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step10.jpg">
				<figcaption>10- Make a first long bubble at the first bend formed by the zigzag.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step11.jpg">
				<figcaption>11- Then make a second long bubble, identical to the first, normally it should fall more or less at the second bend formed by the zigzag.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step12.jpg">
				<figcaption>12- Twist the two large black bubbles around their base several times to block them at the base of Tux's head.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section >
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step13.jpg">
				<figcaption>13- You should now have a shape resembling this one, with at the center, under the head, the two wings we've just created (the two long black bubbles).</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step14.jpg">
				<figcaption>14- With what's left of the black balloon, make a bubble that's shorter than the previous two. Doing so you will also get one final bubble that should be wedged between the two wings.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step15.jpg">
				<figcaption>15- Then roll this last bubble several times between the wings to keep everything firmly in place. You can now make out Tux's head, wings, back and tail.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step16.jpg">
				<figcaption>16- Go back to the white balloon and form a small, round bubble at the base of Tux's head.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step17.jpg">
				<figcaption>17- Make this bubble into <a href="https://mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-10-skill-5-pinch-twists">a pinch-twist</a> which will enable us to keep Tux's head firmly in place on top of its back and shoulders (or rather its back and wings).</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step18.jpg">
				<figcaption>18- Notice that the rest of the white balloon is naturally located under the pinch-twist.</figcaption>
			</figure>

				<img src="images/step19.jpg">
				<figcaption>19- You will have to feed it through to the other side, so that we can use it to make Tux's belly.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step20.jpg">
				<figcaption>20- <a href="https://mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-11-skill-6-air-pressure-control">Push the air</a> in the white balloon a bit towards the end, and shape a large bubble for the belly which should look a little rounded.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step21.jpg">
				<figcaption>21- Then finish <a href="https://mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-11-skill-6-air-pressure-control">pushing the air all the way to the end of the white balloon</a> so that there is no remaining length of empty balloon.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step22.jpg">
				<figcaption>22- Make a small bubble at the tip of the white balloon.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step23.jpg">
				<figcaption>23- Then wedge the small white bubble into the joint common to the base of the wings, the base of the back, and the tail. It doesn't matter which side the bubble is sticking out from for now. Having done this, we get a large <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-12-skill-7-the-loop">loop</a>.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step24.jpg">
				<figcaption>24- We are now going to learn how to divide one big loop into two smaller loops. To do this, twist the large white loop into two equal parts and take note of the central mark.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step25.jpg">
				<figcaption>25- At the level of this mark, press the balloon to form two large bubbles then hold one of the bubbles firmly in one hand while twisting the other bubble around its base with the other hand, to divide the loop into two equal parts.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step26.jpg">
				<figcaption>26- This way, you get two distinct bubbles. Now let's see how to turn both of them into loops.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step27.jpg">
				<figcaption>27- It's very simple! All you need to do is bring the creases formed at the ends of each bubble together, and thus naturally shape two new (smaller) loops.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step28.jpg">
				<figcaption>28- Hold one of the loops firmly in one hand while twisting the other loop around its base with your other hand to keep them both in place.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step29.jpg">
				<figcaption>29- Finally, place the small bubble, that we had set aside, right between the two loops. We have just made two wide, webbed feet, on which Tux can now stand securely.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step30.jpg">
				<figcaption>30- We are almost finished. All that's left now is the beak! For this, <strong>very lightly</strong> inflate a small round balloon, preferably yellow.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step31.jpg">
				<figcaption>31- Press on the tip of the balloon and, gripping the latex, twist the tip a little so that the air leaves it completely and pushes against the knotted end of the balloon.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step32.jpg">
				<figcaption>32- Gently let go of the latex to enable the air to come back gradually into the balloon, which should now be elongated or at the very least oval.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step33.jpg">
				<figcaption>33- Wedge the knotted end of the beak at the base of the head. Lastly, draw on the eyes, and <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-8-skill-3-how-to-curve-a-balloon">round out</a> the shapes of Tux's wings, back and stomach to put the finishing touches on this sculpture.</figcaption>
