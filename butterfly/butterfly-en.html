		<p>This photo tutorial is a complementary resource for the video <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-18-the-butterfly">Balloon Twisting From Scratch 18 - The Butterfly</a> which you can also find on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MossieurBallon">M么ssieur Ballon's YouTube channel</a>.</p>
		
		<p>There are many different designs for balloon butterflies, which are often very artistic and elaborate. Here is one I particularly like to use. This design is reasonably fast to carry out when faced with a crowd, while remaining a faithful rendition of the light and simple beauty of this small creature.</p>
		
		<p>Making the wings of the butterfly is a lot like <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-14-the-flower">making flower petals</a>, only easier, as there are only four loops to make instead of six.</p>
		
		<p>Ideally, you may want to use a darker-colored balloon for the wings, and a lighter-colored balloon for the body, head, and antennae, which will allow for a clearer, starker contrast when drawing on the face.</p>

				<figcaption>2- Take the end of the balloon and press it to push back a little air; this gives you back a short length of latex to work with.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>13- Like the <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-14-the-flower">flower petals</a>, the idea here is to bring the creases of the bubbles together, and doing so, to fold all 4 bubbles to turn them into small loops (these will be the wings of the butterfly).</figcaption>
