		<p>This photo tutorial is a complementary resource for the video <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-2-the-sword">Balloon Twisting From Scratch 2 - The Sword</a> which you can also find on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MossieurBallon">M么ssieur Ballon's YouTube channel</a>.</p>
		<p>A hit with the children, here's another very easy balloon sculpture to make. You will however learn three new and important basic skills: making loops, pinch-twists, and making a sharp angle on a balloon segment.</p>
		<p>To go over these basic skills in depth and enable yourself to put this tutorial in practice in the best of conditions, please feel free to refer to the following lessons:

				<figcaption>1- Inflate a balloon leaving a very small margin. Let a little air escape, then tie the knot without making it too tight The balloon mustn't be either too compressed or too soft.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step02.jpg">
				<figcaption>2- You should be able to press the balloon between two fingers, without forcing on it too much, or  conversely, without your fingers reaching each other too easily.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step03.jpg">
				<figcaption>3- At about 3 or 4 centimeters (1 1/2 inches) from the knot, press the balloon, and twist...</figcaption>

				<figcaption>4- to form a small, rounded <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-7-skill-2-bubbles">bubble</a></figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step05.jpg">
				<figcaption>5- Holding the bubble with one hand, bend the balloon with the other hand to <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-12-skill-7-the-loop">shape a loop</a> that's 10 to 12 centimeters (4 to 5 inches) high.</figcaption>

				<img src="images/step06.jpg">
				<figcaption>6- Firmly hold both ends of the loop together</figcaption>
			</figure>

		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step07.jpg">
				<figcaption>7- then keep the loop in place by twisting it several times around its base.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step08.jpg">
				<figcaption>8- Open the loop wide to create an opening at least as wide as the balloon is thick.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step09.jpg">
				<figcaption>9- Bring the tip of the remaining length of balloon to the opening in the loop.</figcaption>

		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step10.jpg">
				<figcaption>10- Push the tip of the remaining length of balloon through the opening in the loop, widening the loop slightly with your thumbs if needed, to pass it through the loop.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step11.jpg">
				<figcaption>11- As soon as this portion of balloon is long enough, pull on it to bring most of the remaining portion of balloon through the loop. You will see a second loop take shape.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step12.jpg">
				<figcaption>12- Careful! You shouldn't pull the balloon all the way through, but stop when the second loop is about 15 to 20 centimeters (6 to 8 inches) high.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>13- Our balloon sculpture is now vaguely starting to look like a sword. Now all we need to do is perfect it. Let's start with <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-9-skill-4-make-angles-with-balloons">an angle</a> at the bottom of the sword.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step14.jpg">
				<figcaption>14- With one hand, compress the second loop to bend it into two parts, with the side located under the bubble slightly longer than the other.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step15.jpg">
				<figcaption>15- Gently pinch the newly formed angle to push the air from it, then twist the latex between your forefinger and thumb and release it <strong>very gently</strong> so that the air gradually comes back into the angle.</figcaption>
			</figure>

		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step16.jpg">
				<figcaption>16- You should get this shape: perfectly straight under the first loop, but slightly rounded under the bubble.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step17.jpg">
				<figcaption>17- Pull on the bubble's knot with one hand; meanwhile, with your other hand, you need to bring both ends of the bubble close together, while pushing the center of the bubble away with your middle finger.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step18.jpg">
				<figcaption>18- When both ends of the bubble are touching, twist the bubble around its base to keep it in place.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/step19.jpg">
				<figcaption>19- What you have just made is called a <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-10-skill-5-pinch-twists">pinch-twist</a>. It's a great way to hide knots, and this skill is useful for many other things, as we'll see later on.</figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/step20.jpg">
				<figcaption>20- Push the air to the end of the balloon, if need be, to <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-11-skill-6-air-pressure-control">evenly spread the air</a> over the entire length of the blade.</figcaption>
			</figure>

				<img src="images/step21.jpg">
				<figcaption>21- You may decide to keep the blade nice and straight. By the way, here is how you hold the sword.</figcaption>
