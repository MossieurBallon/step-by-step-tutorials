			This photo tutorial is a companion piece to the video <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-13-skill-8-tulip-twist">Balloon Twisting From Scratch 13 - Skill 8: The Tulip Twist</a> which you can also find on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MossieurBallon">M么ssieur Ballon's YouTube channel</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is the last basic skill a beginner needs under their belt : the "tulip-twist", sometimes also known as an "apple-twist" due to its shape.
		</p>
		<p>
			We will be using this skill quite soon, in an upcoming tutorial: <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-14-the-flower">how to make a balloon flower</a>. This shape can also be used to create the shape of the wheel of a car, etc.

					<figcaption>1- To practice, inflate a balloon to any length.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/step02.jpg">
					<figcaption>2- Place the forefinger of your twisting hand on the balloon knot.</figcaption>
				</figure>

			<section>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/step03.jpg">
					<figcaption>3- Press on the knot to push it inside the balloon.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/step04.jpg">
					<figcaption>4- Push your finger inside fairly deeply so that the knot (inside the balloon) ends up in reach of the thumb and forefinger of your support hand (outside the balloon).</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</section>
			<section>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/step05.jpg">
					<figcaption>5- Catch the knot through the balloon with the thumb and forefinger of your support hand, and hold it firmly in place.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/step06.jpg">
					<figcaption>6- While firmly keeping the knot inside the balloon, slowly pull out the forefinger of your twisting hand from the balloon, if necessary by using the thumb and middle finger of the same hand (or any other available finger) in order to ease the pressure of the air surrounding your forefinger, caught inside the balloon.</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</section>
			<section>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/step07.jpg">
					<figcaption>7- This movement must be carried out very gently, so that you can pull your finger out of the balloon without making it burst (the balloon, that is).</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/step08.jpg">
					<figcaption>8- Using your twisting hand, press the balloon near the knot, still held in place through the sides of the balloon by your support hand.</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</section>
			<section>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/step09.jpg">
					<figcaption>9- Press... and twist, to make a bubble which will trap the knot inside the remaining segment of balloon.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/step10.jpg">
					<figcaption>10- Through the balloon, you can make out the knot trapped outside the tulip-twist. If you wedge another balloon part (flower petals for instance) into the fold between the tulip-twist and the remaining segment of balloon, the tulip-twist will be secure and will not be at risk of getting undone.</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</section>
			<section>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/step11.jpg">
					<figcaption>11- If there's no intention of using another balloon part to secure the fold, you will then have to gently push the knot back inside the tulip-twist while twisting it around its axis.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/step12.jpg">
					<figcaption>12- Through the balloon, you can clearly make out the knot, caught and secure in the middle of the tulip-twist.</figcaption>
