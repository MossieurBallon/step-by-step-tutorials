			This photo tutorial is a companion piece to the video <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-9-skill-4-make-angles-with-balloons">Balloon Twisting From Scratch 9 - Skill 4: Make Angles with Balloons</a> which you can also find on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MossieurBallon">Môssieur Ballon's YouTube channel</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, I'm going to teach you how to make angles (right angles, acute angles, or obtuse angles) with a balloon.
		</p>
		<p>
			This skill is used in the <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-2-the-sword">sword tutorial</a>, in the <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-15-the-giraffe">giraffe tutorial</a>, but also in many models we'll learn to make later, namely for making <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-16-the-love-heart">love hearts</a>.

				<figcaption>4- Then, you must first ease off the pressure from <strong>the base</strong> of your hands  and <strong>gently</strong> move your wrists outwards to let the bent part of the balloon come back out.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>5- Secondly, ease back <strong>the top</strong> of your hands and <strong>gently</strong> pull your hands away from each other to free the rest of the balloon.</figcaption>
