			Here is one version of the ladybug model that is both very simple, and very popular!
		</p>
		<p>
			The main difficulty will probably be in creating the antennae. How do you inflate just the middle part of a modeling balloon? Or, which may at first seem equally confusing, how do you form a bubble that's just at the tip of that modeling balloon?
		</p>
		<p>
			While the technique used to project the air right where you want it may seem a bit complex for a beginner, an alternate solution is to inflate the balloon normally, then to push the air forward, manually and gradually (tediously, even), until it reaches the part of the balloon you want it to be at. Doing so will enable you to successfully create this model.

				<figcaption>1- Moderately inflate the small round balloon, and tie the knot right at the valve.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step02.jpg">
				<figcaption>2- Strongly press the balloon to force the air into the neck of the balloon, which will give it a pear shape.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step03.jpg">
				<figcaption>3- Divide the balloon into two bubbles, a small one (for the ladybug's head) and a large one (for its body).</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step04.jpg">
				<figcaption>4- The small bubble should be on the end with the knot. Then put this balloon aside (wedge the two bubbles under your arm so that they won't get undone).</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step05.jpg">
				<figcaption>5- For the antennae, take the black modeling balloon and only inflate it in the middle, over a length of 5 to 6 fingers maximum (guiding the air through your folded hand to keep the balloon from inflating too soon).</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step06.jpg">
				<figcaption>6- If you don't get the hang of the previous trick, don't panic! Inflate the balloon normally (still over a length of 5 to 6 fingers maximum), </figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step07.jpg">
				<figcaption>7- Press the inflated part at the base of the balloon to push the air farther, towards the middle of the balloon.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step08.jpg">
				<figcaption>8- Repeat as many times as needed.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step09.jpg">
				<figcaption>9- Until the bubble reaches the center of the balloon. </figcaption>

				<img src="images/step10.jpg">
				<figcaption>10- Once the bubble is properly centered, you will need to divide it into two smaller bubbles of equal length. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step11.jpg">
				<figcaption>11- Then get the red balloon back and wedge the crease between the two black bubbles into the crease between the two red bubbles. Twist the bubbles together several times to keep them in place.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>13- Take one of the black bubbles and divide it into two more parts, thus creating a new bubble.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>14- Once the new bubble is formed, hold it firmly in your (twisting) hand...</figcaption>

				<img src="images/step16.jpg">
				<figcaption>16- Firmly press the bubble with your twisting hand to push all the air in it away; it will be guided by the support hand to the tip of the non-inflated part of the balloon and form a bubble there.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step17.jpg">
				<figcaption>17- You should get this shape (if you don't get the hang of this trick, refer to steps 7, 8, and 9 as detailed previously, only this time, you will be pushing the bubble all the way to the tip of the balloon).</figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/step18.jpg">
				<figcaption>18- Tie a knot around the bubble to keep it from going back down.

				<img src="images/step19.jpg">
				<figcaption>19- Gently tighten the knot, to avoid air from getting caught in them; it could otherwise form small, fairly unaesthetic bubbles.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>20- You should get this shape.</figcaption>
