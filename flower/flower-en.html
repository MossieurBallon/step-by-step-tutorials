		<p>This photo tutorial is a companion piece to the video <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-14-the-flower">Balloon Twisting From Scratch 14 - The Flower</a> which you can also find on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MossieurBallon">M么ssieur Ballon's YouTube channel</a>.</p>
		<p>This is the basic model for the balloon flower which is most widespread. Now, basic doesn't necessarily mean simple.</p>
		<p>As such, all basic skills used to create this model have all been seen in the previous tutorials; however, the trick that enables you to create 6 petals with a single movement will likely require some time to get used to and several practice sessions.</p>
		<p>So at the beginning, you may want to inflate the balloon rather less than more, to make things a bit easier.</p>

				<figcaption>1- Inflate one balloon all the way, then let a little air out <strong>before tying a knot</strong>, so that the balloon is more supple and workable.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step02.webp">
				<figcaption>2- Make sure that <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-11-skill-6-air-pressure-control">air pressure is evenly balanced</a> throughout the balloon.</figcaption>

			<figure>

				<figcaption>3- Pick up the tip of the balloon and press it...</figcaption>

				<figcaption>4- to push back a little air, in order to reclaim a short length of latex.</figcaption>

				<img src="images/step05.webp">
				<figcaption>5- Bring both ends of the balloon together.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step06.webp">
				<figcaption>6- Tie both ends of the balloon together to form a large loop.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>7- Bring each side of the loop flat against the other.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step08.webp">
				<figcaption>8- Find the middle of the loop, across from the knot, and form a crease.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step09.webp">
				<figcaption>9- Create two large bubbles at the level of this crease</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/step10.webp">
				<figcaption>10- You should get this shape. This next part will be a little complex; you will likely have to try several times before you get the hang of it.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step11.webp">
				<figcaption>11- Take the large bubbles together in your hands, dividing their length into three roughly equal parts. Alternating each of your hands, you need to press and twist both segments around their base as if you were making regular bubbles.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step12.webp">
				<figcaption>12-  Only here, you're making two bubbles at once, and on top of it your hands aren't moving entirely freely, since they're working more or less at the same time on two different parts of the balloon.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/step13.webp">
				<figcaption>13- Once the bubbles are shaped to your satisfaction, Arrange them in a zigzag shape, like this.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step14.webp">
				<figcaption>14- Hold one end in place with your support hand.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step15.webp">
				<figcaption>15- And compress the other end with your twisting hand.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step16.webp">
				<figcaption>16- The idea here is to bring the creases of the bubbles together, and thus fold all 6 bubbles to turn them into small loops (these will be the flower petals).</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step17.webp">
				<figcaption>17- Ultimately, the support hand will have to grip all of the creases between its thumb and forefinger and be able to hold all 6 bubbles on its own. It's a bit physical, but it's doable after a few tries.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step18.webp">
				<figcaption>18- With the twisting hand, take the 3 loops from one end, and twist them together at the base of the folds held  in the support hand.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step19.webp">
				<figcaption>19- Rotate several times until the petals are all supporting each other in place.</figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/step20.webp">
				<figcaption>20- The petals are done, now let's work on the stem.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step21.webp">
				<figcaption>21- To make the stem, inflate a balloon, preferably a green one, leaving a margin about 3 fingers wide.</figcaption>

				<img src="images/step22.webp">
				<figcaption>22- Start by <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-13-skill-8-tulip-twist">making a tulip-twist</a>.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step23.webp">
				<figcaption>23- Pull any 2 petals apart to insert the crease of the tulip-twist between them</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step24.webp">
				<figcaption>24- To lower pressure and avoid either balloon bursting, you need to gently insert the tulip-twist forward in a few successive circular motions, rather than forcing it straight through in one go.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step25.webp">
				<figcaption>25- Turn the flower over and do the same with the rest of the green balloon, so that the bottom of the stem is also located right at the center of the petals.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step26.webp">
				<figcaption>26- Make two small bubbles one after the other.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step27.webp">
				<figcaption>27- Turn the second bubble into <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-10-skill-5-pinch-twists">a pinch-twist</a>.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step28.webp">
				<figcaption>28- The idea is to have the stem more or less in the same alignment as the flower petals.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step29.webp">
				<figcaption>29- Push the air back to the tip of the remaining length of balloon and <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-11-skill-6-air-pressure-control">make sure the air pressure is distributed evenly throughout its length</a>.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step30.webp">
				<figcaption>30- Bend the remaining portion of balloon into a zigzag. The tip can slightly stick outside of the zigzag.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step31.webp">
				<figcaption>31- Press and block the middle of the zigzag in place and twist both sides of the zigzag in opposite directions. This gives us, in a single movement, two loops of equal length that will form the leaves of the flower.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step32.webp">
				<figcaption>32- Curve the top of the stem a little to give it a more dancing, natural-looking shape.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step33.webp">
				<figcaption>33- Do the same with the bottom of the stem.</figcaption>
