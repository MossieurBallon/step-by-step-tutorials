			Making bubbles is the most basic skill used in balloon modeling. A bubble can be round, or it can be longer, like a kind of "sausage".
		</p>
		<p>
			From the very start, you will have to choose:
		<ul>
			<li>Your <strong>holding hand</strong> is the one you will always use to hold the balloon.</li>
			<li>Your <strong>twisting hand</strong> is the one you will always use to twist the balloon.</li>
			<li>Your <strong>preferred twisting direction</strong> is the direction towards which you will always twist the remaining segment of balloon.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Try out a few different ways to see which works best for you, but once you've made up your mind <strong>always stick to it</strong>! The future quality of your muscle memory depends on it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Last but not least! As long as you hold the first bubble of a row with your holding hand, you hold the remaining segment of balloon in your twisting hand, and you twist every bubble in the row in the same direction... well, the bubbles in the middle will never unravel, even if nothing but thin air seems to prevent them from doing so!  You'll see, it's magic!

				<figcaption>2- Place your other hand (the <strong>twisting</strong> hand) just opposite the first one, and press the balloon with your thumb and forefinger... </figcaption>

				<figcaption>3- all the while twisting the balloon, which will make a crease.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>4- Once the crease is formed, keep twisting the remaining segment of balloon, at least three more times, so that the first bubble is secure.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>5- Without letting go of the balloon, move your fingers to the place where you want to make the second bubble and repeat the process. <strong>Always twist the balloon in the same direction!</strong></figcaption>

				<figcaption>6- Make sure to twist the remaining segment of balloon at least three more times so that the second bubble is secure.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>7- Do the same with the third  bubble. <strong>Don't worry about the bubble in the middle, it will stay in place as long as you stick to the same twisting direction.</strong></figcaption>

				<figcaption>8- Do the same with the fourth bubble. <strong>And again, don't worry about the bubbles in the middle, they will stay in place as long as you stick to the same twisting direction.</strong></figcaption>
