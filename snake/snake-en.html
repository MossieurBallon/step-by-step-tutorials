			This photo tutorial is a complementary resource for the video <a href="http://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-19-the-snake">Balloon Twisting From Scratch 19 - The Snake</a> which you can also find on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MossieurBallon">Môssieur Ballon's YouTube channel</a>.

		<p>
			This realistic looking snake in balloon is sure to be a hit. Yet it is simple enough to be realized quite quickly in a line job. 
        </p>
		<p>
			However before attempting this new model be sure you have acquired most basic ballooning skills including pinch-twists, making sharp angles with balloons, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			Following is a list of tutorials that might help you review and perfect the very basic skills needed for the execution of this new model:

				<figcaption>1- You will need three "260" balloons. Two green for the body and one red for the eyes and tongue.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step02.jpg">
				<figcaption>2- Inflate one of the green "260".</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step03.jpg">
				<figcaption>3- Leave the equivalent of about 7 fingers wide not inflated (but don't worry too much about it since we will scrap unneeded balloon length later on).</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step04.jpg">
				<figcaption>4- Form one round bubble right after the knot.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step05.jpg">
				<figcaption>5- Holding that first bubble in place, fold the balloon roughly to help you evaluate more or less the fifth part of its length.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step06.jpg">
				<figcaption>6- Fold the 2 first fifth parts together (you can let the other parts loose for now).
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step07.jpg">
				<figcaption>7- And form a loop right after the first bubble.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step08.jpg">
				<figcaption>8- Then form a long "sausage" bubble more or less where the end of the 3rd of the fifth parts were. In other words form a bubble about as long as the loop.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step09.jpg">
				<figcaption>9- Form a round bubble right after that long "sausage" bubble.</figcaption>
			</figure>

		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step10.jpg">
				<figcaption>10- And fold the rest of the balloon alongside that long "sausage" bubble.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step11.jpg">
				<figcaption>11- It should now be easy for you to form another long sausage bubble that will be the exact same length as the previous one.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step12.jpg">
				<figcaption>12- You will now be able to twist both long bubbles together around their base.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section >
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step13.jpg">
				<figcaption>13- You should now obtain a figure that looks roughly like this one.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step14.jpg">
				<figcaption>14- Finally, take hold of the round bubble between the two long ones (that you have just twisted together).</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step15.jpg">
				<figcaption>15- And transform it into a pinch-twist.</figcaption>

		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step16.jpg">
				<figcaption>16- Check the length of the remaining part of the balloon... it shouldn't be longer than the last two "sausage" bubbles.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step17.jpg">
				<figcaption>17- If it is too long, like it is here for instance, simply twist the balloon to form one last "sausage" bubble of the proper length,</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step18.jpg">
				<figcaption>18- And do a small incision with a scissor at the end of the non inflated part to let the air escape.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step19.jpg">
				<figcaption>19- Then do a knot at the end of the last "sausage" bubble.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step20.jpg">
				<figcaption>20- And you should now obtain a figure that looks roughly like this one (the green "260" I used here happened to be quite thick, so the non inflated part still holds quite straight, while yours may slag somewhat...). </figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step21.jpg">
				<figcaption>21- Now take the red "260" and inflate it so that you obtain a bubble which should be about as long as the width of your palm and where there should be some slack between the knot and the "mouth" of the balloon.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step22.jpg">
				<figcaption>22- As you'll notice later, the longer the slack, the shorter the size of the tongue. Then fold that long bubble into two smaller bubbles of equal length.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step23.jpg">
				<figcaption>23- Attach these two bubbles together, using the slack and the remnant of the non inflated part of the red balloon (the future tongue).</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step24.jpg">
				<figcaption>24- Once the knot is done, bring only the non inflated part of the red balloon on the other side of the two bubbles and make it go around their joint base. </figcaption>

				<img src="images/step25.jpg">
				<figcaption>25- Pull tight...</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step26.jpg">
				<figcaption>26- So that you obtain something like this. It will form the eyes and the tongue of the balloon snake.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step27.jpg">
				<figcaption>27- Align the two red "eyes" alongside the last two "sausage" bubbles of the green balloon, so that the red "tongue" of the snake is beside the green pinch-twist .</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step28.jpg">
				<figcaption>28- Attach the red slack (the part with the knot), at the base of the green loop (which is also the base of the three sausage bubbles). This doesn't have to be too tight.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step29.jpg">
				<figcaption>29- Cut the extra slack if needed.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step30.jpg">
				<figcaption>30- Next, attach the remnant of the green balloon and the remnant of the red balloon together at their base.</figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/step31.jpg">
				<figcaption>31- Contrary to the previous step, the knot should be quite tight.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step32.jpg">
				<figcaption>32- Cut the rest of the green balloon, but keep the rest of the red balloon (the tongue of the snake).</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step33.jpg">
				<figcaption>33- Bring the pinch-twist closer to the red balloon.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>34- Lock the base of the tongue around the pinch-twist.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>35- You should get something like this...</figcaption>

				<figcaption>37- If necessary pinching its tip to "sharpen" it as much as possible, as shown in the "<a href="http://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-9-skill-4-make-angles-with-balloons">Make Angles With Balloons</a>" tutorial.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>49- For the body of the snake we simply have to make a series of zig-zag (again, refer to the "<a href="http://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-9-skill-4-make-angles-with-balloons">Make Angles With Balloons</a>" tutorial if necessary). .</figcaption>

				<figcaption>51- Or the snake can lift its head up while the rest of its body stays on the ground. Play with a few positions until you find the one you prefer.</figcaption>
