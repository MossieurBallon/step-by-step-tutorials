		<p>This photo tutorial is a companion piece to the video <a href="http://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-8-skill-3-how-to-curve-a-balloon">Balloon Twisting From Scratch 8 - Skill 3: How to Curve a Balloon</a> which you can also find on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MossieurBallon">M么ssieur Ballon's YouTube channel</a>.</p>
		<p>Now let's see how to give a curved shape to a segment of balloon.</p>
		<p>It is an important skill to have because it enables you to refine the smaller details of your balloon models, which will make them more realistic and more natural.</p>
		<p>For example, this will enable you to mimic the rounded shape of a belly on a little dog, a teddy bear, or a penguin; the curve of a flower's stem, or of a sword's blade, etc.</p>
		<p>To go further, we will also see how to very simply make a spiral (there are other ways to do this but we will talk about them later as they are a bit more complex).</p>
		<p>Spiral-shaped balloons can be used to form the body of a snake, or even the suspension spring on a motor vehicle!</p>

				<figcaption>1- Take a balloon in both hands and bend it, near the knot.</figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/step02.webp">
				<figcaption>2- Rub both segments against each other to move the crease downwards,</figcaption>

				<figcaption>4- Keep going back and forth, all the while guiding the balloon, and therefore the crease where the friction is taking place, forward between your hands </figcaption>
			</figure>

				<img src="images/step05.webp">
				<figcaption>5- Little by little the balloon knot will move away from your support hand</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step06.webp">
				<figcaption>6- The idea is to make the whole inflated portion of balloon go through this movement of friction made by your hands,</figcaption>

				<figcaption>7- until the deflated tail end of the balloon reaches your twisting hand.</figcaption>

				<img src="images/step08.webp">
				<figcaption>8- With this method, you can get an almost perfect circle.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step09.webp">
				<figcaption>9- To get a loop, the operation is almost identical, except that you shouldn't let go of the part of balloon that is passing through this hand movement.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>10- You need to keep it compressed in a spiral shape as you gradually work on the whole length of balloon.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step11.webp">
				<figcaption>11- If it's too difficult to keep the spiral compressed only with your support hand, you can use another part of your body to help yourself (as seen in the video).</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/step12.webp">
				<figcaption>12- Once the whole length of the balloon is compressed in the shape of a spiral, firmly hold both ends of the spiral in each of your hands,</figcaption>

				<figcaption>13- and <strong>gently</strong> pull each end as far apart from the other as you can, then let go <strong>just as gently</strong>.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>Once released, the balloon will keep its spiral shape.<br><strong>And see you soon! For another lesson... with M么ssieur Ballon!</strong></figcaption>
