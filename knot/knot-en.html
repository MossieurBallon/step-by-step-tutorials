		<p>This photo tutorial is a companion piece to the video <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-6-skill-1-knots">Balloon Twisting From Scratch 6 - Skill 1: Knots</a> which you can also find on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MossieurBallon">Môssieur Ballon's YouTube channel</a>.</p>
		<p>The aim of this series of tutorials is to teach complete beginners how to learn balloon twisting "from scratch", and I've noticed that at first, quite a few of you, children as well as adults, often have trouble tying balloon knots.</p>
		<p>The advantage of the technique used in this tutorial is that it avoids any friction of the balloon against the skin of your fingers. It's a detail that may seem innocuous but it's very significant when you have to tie hundreds of knots one after the other. And that's exactly what will happen once your fame as a balloon twister reaches beyond your family, your neighborhood, or even your region. Which is why you need to acquire good habits straight from the start.</p>
		<p>Try it slowly and regularly until this sequence of movements has become imprinted into your muscle memory and you can carry it out quickly without even thinking about it.</p>
		<p>Have fun... and practice regularly!</p>
