			This, along with the bubble, is possibly the simplest of all the basic techniques in balloon modeling. This technique is commonly used in many balloon models, and namely, within the Ballooning From Scratch series, it appears in the tutorials for the <a href="http://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-2-the-sword">sword</a>, the <a href="http://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-3-the-frog">frog</a>, the <a href="http://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/balloon-twisting-from-scratch-5-tux-the-penguin">penguin</a>, etc.

			In some cases, if it is large enough and not too compressed, a loop may itself be subsequently divided into two parts to form two new, smaller loops, as we will see at the end of this tutorial.

					<img src="images/step08.jpg">
					<figcaption>8- Press the center of the loop against its base so as to form a crease (and the start of two small loops) then twist one of the two small loops around its base, which will block the whole thing together.</figcaption>
